Sabotage Opportunities:


Resource Depletion:

Scenario: Each party stumbles upon a hidden cache of supplies (food, water, medicine) left by previous travelers.
Sabotage: If one party takes all the supplies, they leave none for the other, causing the second party to struggle with limited resources.


False Information:

Scenario: Each village provides their party with maps and information about the journey.
Sabotage: One party could encounter a hermit or a trader who, after being persuaded or bribed, agrees to mislead the other party with false directions or exaggerated dangers.


Environmental Hazards:

Scenario: Both parties must navigate through a dense forest or a treacherous mountain pass.
Sabotage: One party can set traps (such as pitfall traps, collapsing bridges, or triggering rockslides) that slow down or endanger the other party.


Sabotaging Rest Points:

Scenario: There are designated safe havens or campsites where both parties can rest.
Sabotage: One party can tamper with these sites by poisoning water sources, setting traps, or leaving behind misleading signs indicating danger or redirected paths.


Magical Interference:

Scenario: Both parties have access to magical artifacts or scrolls that can manipulate the environment.
Sabotage: One party can use spells to cause natural disasters (like minor earthquakes, storms, or wildfires) or enchantments that create illusions, misleading the other party.


Sabotaging Equipment:

Scenario: Each party has critical equipment (boats, climbing gear, etc.) necessary for the journey.
Sabotage: One party could secretly damage or steal the other partyâ€™s equipment, making certain obstacles harder to overcome.


Infiltration:

Scenario: Both parties frequently interact with locals or other NPCs along the way.
Sabotage: One party could hire mercenaries or bribe NPCs to ambush or delay the other party under false pretenses.


Specific Sabotage Scenarios:
Drying the Wells:

Scenario: Both parties come across a village where the well is a crucial water source.
Sabotage: The first party to arrive can use a spell or sabotage the well, making it dry up or become poisoned when the second party arrives.


Destroying Bridges:

Scenario: Both parties need to cross a series of old, rickety bridges.
Sabotage: One party can destroy or weaken the bridges after crossing, forcing the other party to find a longer, more dangerous route.


Misdirected Messages:

Scenario: Each party uses messenger birds or magical means to send updates back to their village.
Sabotage: One party intercepts these messages and sends false information back to their village, causing confusion and delay for the other party.


Contaminating Supplies:

Scenario: Both parties have to rely on shared resources found in ancient ruins or temples.
Sabotage: One party can contaminate food supplies with a non-lethal but debilitating substance, causing illness and slowing down the other party.


Sabotaging Rituals:

Scenario: Both parties find that they need to perform a ritual to gain passage or favor from a local deity or spirit.
Sabotage: One party can perform a counter-ritual or desecrate the site, making it impossible for the other party to complete their ritual successfully.


Poisonous Plants:

Scenario: Both parties forage for food in a dense forest.
Sabotage: One party leaves behind or plants poisonous herbs and berries, knowing the other party might consume them unknowingly.


Setting Animals Loose:

Scenario: Both parties camp in a forest where wild animals are a threat.
Sabotage: One party can release a captured dangerous animal or disrupt a nest, causing the creatures to attack the other party.


Implementing Sabotage:
Clues and Evidence: Leave subtle clues that the parties can find, hinting at sabotage. Footprints, remnants of traps, or signs of tampering should be evident but not obvious.

Balance and Fairness: Ensure that sabotage opportunities are balanced, so no party feels overly disadvantaged. Both should have equal chances to sabotage and to be sabotaged.

Impact on Morale: Highlight how these sabotages affect each party's morale and trust within the group. It can lead to interesting role-playing as characters deal with the fallout.

By carefully planning these sabotage opportunities, you can add layers of complexity and challenge to your campaign, enhancing the rivalry and eventual revelation of the true nature of each party.
